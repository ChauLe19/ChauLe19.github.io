# Design Patterns

## Flyweight Design Pattern
> a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

Example: DNA tree

## Composite Design Pattern
>  A structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

Example: Folder and file representation. Folder can compose of other folders and files.

## Visitor Design Pattern
> a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. 

## Strategy Design Pattern
> a design pattern lets us encapsulate and make interchangeable a set of alternative actions that might be performed as part of some larger activity
