# Understanding Electricity 101: The basics (Voltage, Current, Resistance, Power)

---

Hi there,

Let me guess, you are trying to get a sense of electricity? You come to the right place. This blog will give you the basics of understanding of electricity. What you need to do is simple, think of how fluid flows!

## Definition of electricity

> Electricity is the flow of electric charge

Imagine you are a drop of water in the river flowing with thousands of others like you. Similar to that, you are an electric charge (or an electron) rushing through with the crowd of many electrons like you. The flow of electrons is electricity!

| Water Flow  | Electron Flow |

## Current (i)

>   Current is the speed of the electrons flow
>
>   Unit: A (Ampere) (or C/s)    

The current of is how fast the electrons are moving. It's very similar to how fast the water (H2O molecules) is moving.

| Guess how many electrons can pass through that finish line in 1 minute? |

Well, these electrons are incredibly small and we can't see it with our normal eyes. We can't count them electron by electron. Instead, we measure how much electrical charge has passed through. Electrical charge has unit of Coulomb (symbol: C).

> 1 electron = -1.602 x 10-19C
>
> 1 proton = +1.602 x 10-19 C
>
> Note: An electron has a negative charge, and a proton has a positive charge. Therefore, electrons have negative Coulomb, while protons have positive one.

As mentioned, current is the speed of electrical charge. Therefore, if 1 electron passed through the line in 1 second, the current is -1.602 x 10-19 C/s. This current is super small. (In reality, this current won't serve you anything ðŸ˜†.) In application, we need more than this number.
And we also defined:
> 1A = 1C/s
>
> A: Ampere
>
> C/s = Coulomb per second

Ampere is the SI unit for electric current. As we move on, we use Ampere to describe electric current. 


## Voltage (v)
> Voltage is the potential difference between two points in the circuit, or how much energy transferred per charge   
>
> Unit: V (Volt) (or J/C)   

Think of a water pipe that has different pressure on the two ends. The force from the higher pressure end pushes the waterto the lower pressure end. The larger the difference pressure between two ends, the higher speed and higher the water flow has.

Similarly, voltage is the potential difference between two ends of the wire. The difference in potential pushes electrons through the wire to the lower potential. In battery, the chemical reaction produce a higher potential at one end. (See [how batteries work?](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/batteries.html)) 

| ![Water Potential](/images/water_potential.jpg) | ![Voltage](/images/voltage.jpg) |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| Gravity causes high potential that make water fall | Electrons repel each other that causes a higher potential at the area with higher density of electrons and move to the other side |

We defined:
> 1V = 1J/C
>
> V: Volts
>
>J/C: Joules per Coulomb

The higher the difference leads to higher energy being transferred per charge. (or the higher pressure difference of the pipe can lead water to have more energy) Therefore, we can also define Voltage as how much work is being transferred per charge.

## Resistance (R)
> Resistance is the hindrance for current to flow  
>
> Unit: Î© (Ohm) (or V/A)    

Continuing with our fluid flow analogy, a water pipe can have a larger or smaller cross-section. A pipe with a smaller cross-section will slow the amount of water can flow through compared to one with a bigger cross-section. The fluid is also a factor to the flow, since a thicker fluid will flow slower than a thinner fluid and vice versa.

In electricity, conductivity and thickness are two factors that can contribute to resistance. For conductivity, we can think of metals, which are more conductive than plastic for an example. (See why?) Wire thickness can also prevent electron flows similar to our water pipes. However, since wires are used to conduct electricity, in most electricity analysis, they are assumed to have zero resistance.
Note: besides conductivity and thickness, there is also heat and electrical components which are being used, such as LEDs, resistors, capacitors, diode, etc. that can change resistance.

> v= iR

> v: Voltage
>
> i: Current
>
> R: Resistance
>
> =>     R = v/i    
>
> From what we have defined current and voltage, the unit of resistance is:
Unit of Resistance = V/A

## Power (p)
> Power is the electrical energy transferred per unit of time    
>
> Unit: W (Watt) (or J/s)    

Power shows how much work can be done in an amount of time. The higher the power, the more work done in the same amount of time.

Power is calculated to be:
> p = vi    
>
> p: Power
>
> v: Voltage
>
> i: Current

Using units of voltage and current to find the unit of power:
> p = vi    = volts x amperes
>           = (J/C) x (C/s)
>           = J/s

We define:
> 1 J/s = 1 W
>
> J/s: Joules per Second
>
> W: Watts

RECAP:

|:----:|:--------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Current | the speed of moving electrons |	i |	A |
| Voltage |	potential difference between two points in the circuit | v | V|
| Resistance | hindrance for current to flow |	R |	Î© |
| Power | electrical energy transferred per unit of time | p | W |

Ohm's Law: v = iR
